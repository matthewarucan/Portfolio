## Python Projects
### [San Francisco Airbnb Regulation Impact Analysis](https://github.com/matthewarucan/Airbnb)
Evaluated the impact of San Francisco’s 2018 Airbnb regulations on housing markets using a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach. Cleaned and merged rent (ZORI), home value (ZHVI), and Airbnb listing datasets at the ZIP-code level, then classified areas by Airbnb activity intensity. Found that rent growth slowed in high-Airbnb ZIP codes post-policy, while home values continued to rise—suggesting the regulation curbed rental pressure without discouraging long-term investment. Delivered actionable insights through visualizations and statistical modeling using Python.

**Tools Used:** Python (Pandas, GeoPandas, Statsmodels, Matplotlib), Zillow/Inside Airbnb datasets

### [eBay Sales Analysis](https://github.com/matthewarucan/E-commerce-Analytics/blob/main/README.md)
Conducted an end-to-end analysis of personal eBay sales data over a four-year span to identify drivers of seasonal revenue drops, particularly in Q4. Cleaned and transformed raw transaction data using Python (Pandas), then performed descriptive and time-series analyses to uncover trends. Key findings included a 111% increase in revenue from items offering free shipping and a 94% drop in Christmas-season sales compared to back-to-school periods. Delivered actionable strategies, such as targeted Q4 promotions, free shipping campaigns, and optimization of top-performing categories like men’s shoes.

**Tools Used:** Python (Pandas), MS Excel, Tableau

## SQL Projects
### [Bellabeat Wellness Tech: Fitbit User Engagement Insights](https://github.com/matthewarucan/Google-Data-Analytics-Case-Study)
Explored Fitbit device usage to identify behavioral trends for Bellabeat, a women-focused health-tech brand. Used SQL to clean and aggregate daily activity, heart rate, and sleep metrics across thousands of users. Created Tableau dashboards highlighting peak engagement windows and fitness patterns, helping guide product marketing and feature prioritization.

**Tools Used:** MySQL, MS Excel, Tableau

## Excel Projects
### [ER Games: Launch Strategy Evaluation](https://github.com/matthewarucan/ER-Games)
Modeled the launch strategy for ER Games’ new puzzle-RPG by analyzing player feedback, demographic segments, and regional sales projections. Used Excel to calculate KPIs, run A/B testing scenarios, and build classification models forecasting market performance. Created Tableau dashboards summarizing top launch regions and projected adoption curves, supporting go/no-go decisions by product stakeholders.

**Tools Used:** MS Excel, Tableau, JMP

### [Retail Channel Concentration & Revenue-at-Risk Analysis](https://github.com/matthewarucan/Adidas)
Performed a channel concentration and risk analysis on Adidas U.S. sales data to assess revenue dependency across Retailer × Region × State × City combinations. Used Excel to create a dynamic scenario tool and KPI dashboard that quantified Revenue-at-Risk (RaR) with adjustable substitution assumptions. Calculated Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI) quarterly, revealing a shift from high concentration (HHI = 0.445 in 2020 Q1) to low (HHI = 0.021 in 2021 Q4). Identified critical channels (>2% of revenue) and provided actionable recommendations to diversify mid-tier partnerships, protect high-risk accounts, and monitor channel risk over time.

Mined over 1 million Airbnb listings to surface trends in guest reviews, listing quality, and seasonal pricing. Used Tableau to visualize key drivers of booking demand, including property type, availability windows, and review sentiment. Created visual summaries of high-converting listings to inform host strategies and market positioning.

**Tools Used:** Microsoft Excel (PivotTables, XLOOKUP, KPI Dashboards, Conditional Formatting)

## Tableau Projects
### [Airbnb 2016 Data Analysis: Listings, Reviews, and Pricing Insights](https://github.com/matthewarucan/Tableau-Airbnb)
Analyzed over 1 million records from the Airbnb 2016 Listings dataset, which included data on property features, guest reviews, availability, and pricing. Structured and explored listing details (e.g., bedrooms, bathrooms, location), sentiment indicators from review text, and temporal patterns from the calendar data. Prepared the dataset for visualization to identify trends in booking behavior, seasonal price fluctuations, and characteristics of high-demand properties.

**Tools Used:** Tableau
